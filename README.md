# chime-elixir
A [Chime][chime] extension for Elixir.

## Overview

This Chime extension supports the [Elixir][elixir] programming language. It integrates [ElixirLS][elixir-ls] with [ChimeKit][chimekit]'s `ExtensionProtocol`.

## Usage

This extension requires that `elixir-ls` be accessible in the user's `PATH`.

## Contributing and Collaboration

I would love to hear from you! Issues or pull requests work great. A [Discord server][discord] is also available for live help, but I have a strong bias towards answering in the form of documenation.

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.
